# Scene Text Detection With Gradient Morphology

Detecting scene text (Text in wild images not in noob documents) with basic image processing techniques like image-dilation and erosion and absolutely zero Machine Learning ðŸ˜² 
This is built with OpenCV only because the image processing methods are readily available. To run this use `detext.jar` inside `jar-build` folder. Running it will create a 'filename_localized.jpg' in the same path as of the input.

```shell
java -jar jar-build/detextscene.jar test.jpeg
```

Note: You need Java 18 to run this as we are using very new version of OpenCV
